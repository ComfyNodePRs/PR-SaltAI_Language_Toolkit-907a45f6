# Why This Project

Salt.AI's vision is to foster a thriving AI ecosystem enabling the worldâ€™s developers to build and share innovative work, redefining software creation, pushing progress forward, and ensuring the positive promise of AI benefits to as many as possible.

This project enables users to connect AI models to their data how they specify.

# What

This connects the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tool Llama-Index
To the popular reconfigurable flow node interface ComfyUI

This lets you load files into the UI, send them to an AI model, have it process that
information, and provide relevant results to you.

# How

## Installation

### With Git and Pip

cd into your custom_nodes folder
git clone this project into your custom_nodes folder
cd into this project folder
run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

// # Using ComfyUI Manager

// Find our package on ComfyUI Manager
// click install
// click restart when ready
// Hit Ctrl+F5 in the browser when ready

### If you're using the portable version of ComfyUI 

You'll have to run against the environments python:

`path\to\ComfyUI\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### If pip fails 

To install some of the requirements because of version collisions, this is likely because you don't have venv setup correctly.
